## Post body

**What it is**  
Money Budget is a personal budget app. You upload your bank statement or credit card transaction history as a PDF (once a month or whenever you want). AI extracts and categorizes the transactions. You review, tweak categories, and save. No bank linking, no sharing account credentials, no daily manual logging.

**Why I built it**  
I wanted to see where my money goes without connecting my bank or entering every transaction by hand. So: upload a statement → AI does the heavy lifting → I only fix a few categories and add custom ones. Data stays in my account (Firebase), and I can use custom categories and recurring transactions.

**What it does**
- Upload PDF (bank/credit card statements)
- AI parses and categorizes transactions
- Review & edit categories (including drag-and-drop)
- Custom categories, recurring transactions
- Dashboard: monthly spending, income, category breakdown, calendar view
- Optional subscription (free trial, then paid tiers for more uploads)

**Tech:** Next.js, Firebase (Auth + Firestore), OpenAI for categorization, Stripe for subscriptions, deployed on Vercel.

**Looking for:** Honest feedback—UX, missing features, pricing, or “this would be useful if…”—and any ideas for the next SaaS you’d want to see in this space.
